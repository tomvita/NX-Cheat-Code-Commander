# Release Notes: Version 1.2.1

## New Features and Enhancements

*   **Fit 1 & Fit 2 Buttons:**
    *   **Fit 1:** Adjusts the width of each panel to fit its content, including cheat titles. This is useful for getting a quick overview of all your cheats.
    *   **Fit 2:** Similar to Fit 1, but it ignores cheat titles when calculating the optimal width. This provides a more compact view that focuses on the code.

*   **Word Wrap Checkbox:**
    *   A new "Word Wrap" checkbox has been added to the main window. When enabled, text in all panels will wrap to fit the panel width. When disabled, text will not wrap, and a horizontal scrollbar will appear if necessary. This setting is saved and will be restored on the next launch.

*   **Improved Click-to-Sync Behavior:**
    *   Left-clicking a cheat's title in any panel will now synchronize all other panels to display the same cheat.
    *   If you click within the body of a cheat and its title is not currently visible, the panel will automatically scroll to bring the title into view before synchronizing. This ensures you never lose context.
