# Cheat Code Commander Examples

[Example 1: God Mode]
# This cheat writes a new health value to a static memory address.
# It also demonstrates using assembly instructions directly.
[Main+R0+0x100100] = 0x3E7 # Set health to 999
[Main+R0+0x100104] = mov x1, #1 # Move the value 1 into register x1

[Example 2: Infinite Ammo]
# This cheat uses a .word directive to write a 32-bit value.
[Main+R0+0x200200] = .word 0xFFFFFFFF # Max ammo

[Example 3: Custom Item]
# This demonstrates using .float for floating point values
# and .byte for single byte values.
[Main+R0+0x300300] = .float 99.9
[Main+R0+0x300304] = .byte 0x0A

[Example 4: Pointer-based Writing]
# Auto-incrementing a pointer register after a write.
[R10] = 0xCAFEBABE W=4 R10+

[Example 5: Conditional Cheats]
# Only activate the cheat if a certain condition is met.
if [Main+0x400400] == 1
  [Main+R0+0x500500] = 1
endif

[Example 6: Keypress Activated Cheat]
# Activate cheat by holding down L+R buttons.
if keyheld L + R
  R1 = 1
